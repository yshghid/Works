It\\'s exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner.\\nIt simplifies the development process by enabling the creation of cyclical graphs, which are essential for developing agent runtimes. With LangGraph, we can easily build robust, scalable, and flexible multi-agent systems.\\nIf you want to learn more about the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this introduction to LangChain.\\nWhat Is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph enables us to create stateful, multi-actor applications utilizing LLMs as easily as possible. It extends the capabilities of LangChain, introducing the ability to create and manage cyclical graphs, which are pivotal for developing sophisticated agent runtimes. The core concepts of LangGraph include: graph structure, state management, and coordination.\\nGraph structure\\nImagine your application as a directed graph. In LangGraph, each node represents an LLM agent, and the edges are the communication channels between these agents. This structure allows for clear and manageable workflows, where each agent performs specific tasks and passes information to other agents as needed.\\nState management\\nOne of LangGraph\\'s standout features is its automatic state management. This feature enables us to track and persist information across multiple interactions. As agents perform their tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs.\\nCoordination\\nLangGraph ensures agents execute in the correct order and that necessary information is exchanged seamlessly. This coordination is vital for complex applications where multiple agents need to work together to achieve a common goal. By managing the flow of data and the sequence of operations, LangGraph allows developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination.\\nWhy LangGraph?\\nAs I mentioned above, LangGraph offers several significant advantages for developers working with complex LLM applications. Here are some of the real-world benefits LangGraph offers.\\nSimplified development\\nLangGraph abstracts away the complexities associated with state management and agent coordination. This means developers can define their workflows and logic without worrying about the underlying mechanisms that ensure data consistency and proper execution order. This simplification accelerates the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors. It’s a game-changer!\\nFlexibility\\nWith LangGraph, developers have the flexibility to define their own agent logic and communication protocols. This allows for highly customized applications tailored to specific use cases. Whether you need a chatbot that can handle various types of user requests or a multi-agent system that performs complex tasks, LangGraph provides the tools to build exactly what you need. It’s all about giving you the power to create.\\nScalability\\nLangGraph is built to support the execution of large-scale multi-agent applications. Its robust architecture can handle a high volume of interactions and complex workflows, enabling the development of scalable systems that can grow with your needs. This makes it suitable for enterprise-level applications and scenarios where performance and reliability are critical.\\nFault tolerance\\nReliability is a core consideration in the design of LangGraph. The library includes mechanisms for gracefully handling errors, ensuring that your application can continue to operate even when individual agents encounter issues. This fault tolerance is essential for maintaining the stability and robustness of complex multi-agent systems. Peace of mind is just a feature away.\\nGetting Started With LangGraph\\nLet’s see how we can set up LangGraph and what the basic concepts are.\\nInstallation\\nTo install LangGraph, you can use pip:\\npip install -U langgraph\\nBasic Concepts\\nNodes: Nodes represent units of work within your LangGraph. They are typically Python functions that perform a specific task, such as:\\n\\nInteracting with an LLM\\nCalling a tool or API\\nPerforming some data manipulation\\nReceiving user input\\nExecuting business logic\\n\\nIn LangGraph, you can add nodes using the graph.add_node(name, value) syntax.\\nEdges: Edges are communication channels between nodes. They define the flow of information and the order of execution. You can add edges using the graph.add_edge(node1, node2) syntax.\\nState: The state is a central object updated over time by the nodes in the graph. It manages the internal state of your application and can be overridden or added to, depending on the application\\'s requirements. This state can hold things such as:\\n\\nConversation history: A list of messages between the agent and the user.\\nContextual data: Information relevant to the current task or interaction.\\nInternal variables: Flags, counters, or other variables to track the agent\\'s progress and behavior.\\n\\nBuilding a Simple LangGraph Application\\nHere’s a step-by-step example of creating a basic chatbot application using LangGraph.\\nStep 1: Define the StateGraph\\nDefine a StateGraph object to structure the chatbot as a state machine. The State is a class object defined with a single key messages of type List and uses the add_messages() function to append new messages rather than overwrite them.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # messages have the type \"list\".\\n    # The add_messages function appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\nStep 2: Initialize an LLM and add it as a Chatbot node\\nHere, we initialize the AzureChatOpenAI model and create a simple chatbot function that takes in the state messages as input and generates a message response (which is subsequently appended to the state).\\nThis chatbot function is added as a node named “chatbot” to the graph.\\n```\\nfrom langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI\\nllm = AzureChatOpenAI(\\n    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],\\n    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],\\n)\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n‘’’The first argument is the unique node name\\nThe second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever the node is used.’’’\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n```\\nStep 3: Set edges\\nSince we are building a simple chatbot, we set the chatbot node as both the entry and finish points of the graph to indicate where to start and end the process.\\n```\\nSet entry and finish points\\ngraph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.set_finish_point(\"chatbot\")\\n```\\nStep 4: Compile and Visualize the Graph\\nCompile the graph to create a CompiledGraph object, and optionally, we can visualize the graph structure using the code below:\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile()\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\ntry:\\n    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\nexcept Exception:\\n    pass\\n\\nStep 5: Run the chatbot\\nFinally, we implement a loop to continuously prompt the user for input, process it through the graph, and print the assistant\\'s response. The loop exits when the user types \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"q\".\\n```\\nRun the chatbot\\nwhile True:\\n    user_input = input(\"User: \")\\n    if user_input.lower() in [\"quit\", \"exit\", \"q\"]:\\n        print(\"Goodbye!\")\\n        break\\n    for event in graph.stream({\"messages\": [(\"user\", user_input)]}):\\n        for value in event.values():\\n            print(\"Assistant:\", value[\"messages\"][-1].content)\\n```\\nAdvanced LangGraph Features\\nNow that we covered the basics, let’s take a look at some advanced features.\\nCustom node types\\nLangGraph allows you to create custom node types to implement complex agent logic. This provides flexibility and control over your application\\'s behavior.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nclass MyCustomNode:\\n    def __init__(self, llm):\\n        self.llm = llm\\n    def __call__(self, state):\\n        # Implement your custom logic here\\n        # Access the state and perform actions\\n        messages = state[\"messages\"]\\n        response = self.llm.invoke(messages)\\n        return {\"messages\": [response]}\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")\\ncustom_node = MyCustomNode(llm)\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"custom_node\", custom_node)\\nHere, we define a class MyCustomNode that encapsulates custom logic and interacts with the LLM. This provides a more structured and maintainable way to implement complex node behaviors.\\nEdge types\\nLangGraph supports different edge types to handle various communication patterns between nodes. One useful type is the conditional edge, which allows for decision-making based on a node\\'s output.\\nTo create a conditional edge, you need three components:\\n\\nThe upstream node: The node\\'s output decides the next step.\\nA function: This function evaluates the upstream node\\'s output and determines the next node to execute, returning a string that represents the decision.\\nA mapping: This mapping links the possible outcomes of the function to the corresponding nodes to be executed.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\ngraph.add_conditional_edge(\\n    \"model\",\\n    should_continue,\\n    {\\n        \"end\": END,\\n        \"continue\": \"tools\"\\n    }\\n)\\nHere, after the “model” node is called, we can either exit the graph (”end”) and return to the user, or we can continue (”continue”) and call a tool—depending on what the user decides!\\nState management\\nLangGraph offers powerful state management techniques, which include using external databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, or cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage to store and retrieve your agent\\'s state, enabling reliability and scalability.\\nHere\\'s an example of using a SQLite database for state management:\\n```\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\\nConnect to the SQLite database\\nmemory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(\":memory:\")\\nCompile the graph with the checkpointer\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n```\\nError handling\\nLangGraph also provides mechanisms for error handling:\\n\\nExceptions: Node functions can raise exceptions to signal errors during execution. You can catch and handle these exceptions to prevent your graph from crashing.\\nRetry mechanisms: You can implement retry logic within your nodes to handle transient errors, such as network issues or API timeouts.\\nLogging: Use logging to record errors and track the execution of your graph.\\n\\nReal-World Applications of LangGraph\\nLangGraph can be used to build a wide range of applications.\\nChatbots\\nLangGraph is ideal for developing sophisticated chatbots that can handle a wide array of user requests. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, these chatbots can process natural language queries, provide accurate responses, and seamlessly switch between different conversation topics. The ability to manage state and coordinate interactions ensures that the chatbot maintains context and delivers a coherent user experience.\\nAutonomous agents\\nFor applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic.\\nThese agents can execute complex workflows, interact with other systems, and adapt to new information dynamically. LangGraph\\'s structured framework ensures that each agent operates efficiently and effectively, making it suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring.\\nMulti-Agent systems\\nLangGraph excels in building applications where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a common goal. For example, different agents can manage inventory, process orders, and coordinate deliveries in a supply chain management system. LangGraph\\'s coordination capabilities ensure that each agent communicates effectively, sharing information and making decisions in a synchronized manner. This leads to more efficient operations and better overall system performance.\\nWorkflow automation tools\\nWith LangGraph, automating business processes and workflows becomes straightforward. Intelligent agents can be designed to handle tasks such as document processing, approval workflows, and data analysis. By defining clear workflows and leveraging LangGraph\\'s state management, these tools can execute complex sequences of actions without human intervention, reducing errors and increasing productivity.\\nRecommendation systems\\nPersonalized recommendation systems can greatly benefit from LangGraph\\'s capabilities. By employing multiple agents to analyze user behavior, preferences, and contextual data, these systems can deliver tailored suggestions for products, content, or services. LangGraph\\'s flexibility allows for integrating various data sources and algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.\\nPersonalized learning environments\\nIn educational platforms, LangGraph can be used to create adaptive learning environments that cater to individual learning styles and needs. Multiple agents can assess a student\\'s progress, provide customized exercises, and offer real-time feedback. The stateful nature of LangGraph ensures that the system retains information about each learner\\'s performance and preferences, enabling a more personalized and effective educational experience.\\nConclusion\\nLangGraph significantly simplifies the development of complex LLM applications by providing a structured framework for managing state and coordinating agent interactions.\\nPotential developments for LangGraph include integration with other LangChain components, support for new LLM models, and the introduction of more advanced agent runtimes from academia.\\nIf you want to learn more about developing applications within the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this course on developing LLM applications with LangChain.\\n\\n\\nAuthor\\nRyan Ong\\n\\nRyan is a lead data scientist specialising in building AI applications using LLMs. He is a PhD candidate in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs at Imperial College London, where he also completed his Master’s degree in Computer Science.

However, as the demand for more sophisticated AI applications grows, there’s a need for systems that go beyond these retrieval capabilities. Enter AI agents — autonomous entities capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks, maintaining state across interactions, and dynamically adapting to new information. LangGraph, a powerful extension of the LangChain library, is designed to help developers build these advanced AI agents by enabling stateful, multi-actor applications with cyclic computation capabilities.\\nIn this article, we’ll explore how LangGraph transforms AI development and provide a step-by-step guide on how to build your own AI agent using an example that computes energy savings for solar panels. This example will showcase how LangGraph’s unique features can create intelligent, adaptable, and real-world-ready AI systems.\\nWhat is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph is an advanced library built on top of LangChain, designed to enhance your Large Language Model (LLM) applications by introducing cyclic computational capabilities. While LangChain allows the creation of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for linear workflows, LangGraph takes this a step further by enabling the addition of cycles, which are essential for developing complex, agent-like behaviors. These behaviors allow LLMs to continuously loop through a process, dynamically deciding what action to take next based on evolving conditions.\\nAt the heart of LangGraph is the concept of a stateful graph:\\nLangGraph redefines AI development by seamlessly managing graph structure, state, and coordination, empowering the creation of sophisticated, multi-actor applications. With automatic state management, LangGraph ensures that context is preserved across interactions, enabling your AI to respond intelligently to changing inputs. Its streamlined agent coordination guarantees precise execution and efficient information exchange, letting you focus on crafting innovative workflows rather than technical intricacies. LangGraph’s flexibility allows for the development of tailored, high-performance applications, while its scalability and fault tolerance ensure your systems remain robust and reliable, even at the enterprise level.\\nStep-by-step Guide\\nNow that we have a solid understanding of what LangGraph is and how it enhances AI development, let’s dive into a practical example. In this scenario, we’ll build an AI agent designed to calculate potential energy savings for solar panels based on user input. This agent can be implemented as a lead generation tool on a solar panel seller’s website, where it interacts with potential customers, offering personalized savings estimates. By gathering key data such as monthly electricity costs, this AI agent helps educate customers on the financial benefits of solar energy while simultaneously qualifying leads for follow-up by the sales team. This example showcases the power of LangGraph in creating intelligent, dynamic systems that can automate complex tasks and drive business value.\\nStep 1: Import Necessary Libraries\\nWe start by importing all the essential Python libraries and modules required for the project.\\nThese imports set the foundation for utilizing LangChain, LangGraph, and AWS services to build our AI assistant.\\nStep 2: Define the Tool for Calculating Solar Savings\\nNext, we define a tool that will handle the computation of energy savings based on the monthly electricity cost provided by the user.\\nThis function processes the user’s monthly electricity cost and returns a detailed estimate of the solar panel system’s benefits, including the number of panels required, installation costs, and net savings over ten years. For simplicity, we have made a few assumptions in the calculations, such as the average cost per kilowatt-hour and average sunlight hours. However, in a more advanced version of this AI agent, we could gather this information directly from the user, tailoring the estimates more precisely to their unique circumstances.\\nStep 3: Set Up State Management and Error Handling\\nEffective state management and error handling are crucial for building robust AI systems. Here, we define utilities to manage errors and maintain the conversation’s state.\\nThese functions ensure that any errors encountered during the tool’s execution are handled gracefully, providing helpful feedback to the user.\\nStep 4: Define the State and Assistant Class\\nIn this step, we’ll define how the AI agent manages its state (the ongoing context of the conversation) and ensure it responds appropriately to the user’s input and tool output.\\nTo do this, we create a State class using Python's TypedDict to define the structure of the messages that will be passed around. The state will hold messages, including input from the user and output from the agent or tools.\\nNext, we create the Assistant class, which is responsible for running the AI agent, interacting with the tools, and managing the flow of the conversation. The Assistant invokes the tools, ensures they return appropriate results, and handles any re-prompts or errors that may occur during execution. Its core functionality includes invoking the Runnable, which defines the process of calling the LLM and tools like compute_savings, and then monitoring the results. If the agent fails to return a valid response or if a tool doesn't provide meaningful data, the Assistant re-prompts the user or requests clarification. It continues to loop through the Runnable until a valid output is obtained, ensuring smooth execution and effective responses.\\nThis setup is essential for maintaining the flow of conversation and ensuring that the assistant responds appropriately based on the context.\\nStep 5: Set Up the LLM with AWS Bedrock\\nIn this step, we configure the Large Language Model (LLM) using AWS Bedrock, which will power the AI assistant’s language capabilities. AWS Bedrock allows us to access advanced LLMs such as Anthropic’s Claude. To interact with AWS services, you need to have your AWS credentials configured. This means you must either have your AWS credentials set in your environment (through the AWS CLI or environment variables) or use a credentials file that AWS SDKs can access. Without proper AWS configuration, the assistant won’t be able to connect to AWS services like Bedrock for running the LLM.\\nThis integration ensures that the assistant can effectively interpret and respond to user inputs.\\nStep 6: Define the Assistant’s Workflow\\nNow that we have set up the LLM and tools, the next step is to define the AI assistant’s workflow. This involves creating a template for the conversation, specifying the tools that the assistant will use, and configuring how the AI agent will respond to user input and trigger different functions (like calculating solar savings). The workflow is essentially the logic that governs how the assistant interacts with users, gathers information, and calls tools to provide results.\\nThe first part of the workflow involves creating a prompt template that defines how the assistant will communicate with the user. The prompt helps guide the AI assistant in determining what to ask the user, how to respond based on the input, and when to trigger tools like compute_savings.\\nIn this case, the assistant needs to ask the user for their monthly electricity cost to calculate solar panel savings. Here’s how we define the conversation:\\nNext, we define the tools that the assistant will use during the interaction, with the primary tool being compute_savings, which calculates potential savings based on the user's monthly electricity cost. After specifying the tools in the list, we bind them to the assistant's workflow using the llm.bind_tools() method. This step ensures that the AI assistant can access and trigger the tools as needed during the conversation, creating a seamless interaction between the user and the assistant.\\nStep 7: Build the Graph Structure\\nIn this step, we construct the graph structure for the AI assistant using LangGraph, which controls how the assistant processes user input, triggers tools, and moves between stages. The graph defines nodes for the core actions (like invoking the assistant and tool) and edges that dictate the flow between these nodes.\\nEach node in LangGraph represents an operational step, such as interacting with the user or executing a tool. We define two key nodes for this AI assistant:\\nEdges define how the flow moves between nodes. Here, the assistant starts the conversation, then transitions to the tool once the required input is collected, and returns to the assistant after the tool’s execution.\\nWe use MemorySaver to ensure the graph retains the conversation state across different steps. This allows the assistant to remember the user’s input, ensuring continuity in multi-step interactions.\\nStep 8: Running the Assistant\\nFinally, you can run the assistant by initiating the graph and starting the conversation.\\nConclusion\\nBy following these steps, you have successfully created an AI assistant using LangGraph that can calculate solar panel energy savings based on user inputs. This tutorial demonstrates the power of LangGraph in managing complex, multi-step processes and highlights how to leverage advanced AI tools to solve real-world challenges efficiently. Whether you’re developing AI agents for customer support, energy management, or other applications, LangGraph provides the flexibility, scalability, and robustness needed to bring your ideas to life.\\nInterested in visualizing and testing this agent using LangGraph Studio?
